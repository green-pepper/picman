2006-04-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@picman.org>

	* doc/pypicman.sgml: applied documentation patch contributed by
	Sylvain Fourmanoit (bug #339886).

2005-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@picman.org>

	* plug-ins/benchmark-foreground-extract.py (benchmark): removed
	run-mode parameters again.  Seems to have been fixed in pypicman.

2005-09-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@picman.org>

	* picmanmodule.c (pypicman_progress_install): undeprecated.

2005-08-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@picman.org>

	* picmanmodule.c
	* picman-drawable.c: use canonical procedure names with
	picman_run_procedure().

2005-08-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@picman.org>

	* plug-ins/benchmark-foreground-extract.py: pass run-mode to PDB
	calls.

2005-08-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@picman.org>

	* pypicman-rgb.c: added wrapper for picman_rgb_luminance().

2005-07-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@picman.org>

	* plug-ins/benchmark-foreground-extract.py: follow PDB API change.

2005-07-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@picman.org>

	* plug-ins/benchmark-foreground-extract.py: allow to have the
	output images saved, made the code more robust, corrected some
	mistakes.

2005-07-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@picman.org>

	* plug-ins/benchmark-foreground-extract.py: show elapsed time.

2005-07-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@picman.org>

	* Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/benchmark-foreground-extract.py: added a rough
	implementation of the foreground extraxtion benchmark as proposed
	in the GrabCut paper. See comments in the file for details.

2005-06-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@picman.org>

	* plug-ins/foggify.py: fixed capitalization of menu label.

2004-12-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@picman.org>

	* Makefile.am: added $(pypicman_DATA) to EXTRA_DIST.

2003-02-08  Manish Singh  <yosh@picman.org>

	* picmanui.py: use dialog.run() for sub dialogs, since the main dialog
	is also doing that. This does break consistency with the rest of
	picman, but will do for now. I wish there was a similar API that didn't
	set the dialog modal. Fixed brush and pattern list to use the new
	PDB names. Also make the filesel really have a title of "Files"

	* picmanshelf.py: minor clean up, use cStringIO if available

	* picmanfu.py: add support for Load/Save plug-ins. Use GtkImage
	instead of deprecated GtkPixmap.

	* picmanenums.py: regenerated

	* plug-ins/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/colorhtml.py: the return of colorhtml to 1.3

2003-01-08  Manish Singh  <yosh@picman.org>

	* plug-ins/picmancons.py: import gtkcons only when we're about to use
	it. This and below allows plug-in query to work even without an
	interface.

	* plug-ins/pdbbrowse.py: define BrowseWin (which needs gtk) only
	when we need it and are guaranteed a gui setup.

2002-11-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@picman.org>

	* plug-ins/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): added missing file (#98034).

2002-08-31  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* picmanfu.py (RadioEntry): add PF_RADIO support to picmanfu based on
	Yosh's patch.
	(_interact): swap order of buttons to match other dialogs.

2002-08-30  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* pypicman-*.c: update to list all methods.  Convert no arg
	functions to METH_NOARG (slight code size reduction).

	* pypicman-drawable.c (PyPicmanDrawable_Type): add getsets for common
	drawable attributes.
	(PyPicmanLayer_Type): convert getattr and setattr to getsets.
	(PyPicmanChannel_Type): convert to getsets.

	* picmanmodule.c (new_parasite): remove.  Superceded by
	picman.Parasite constructor.
	(pypicman_image_list): rename to match actual API.

	* pypicman-parasite.c (PyPicmanParasite_Type): switch to getsets.
	(para_init): add constructor.

	* pypicman-tile.c (PyPicmanPixelRgn_Type): convert to use getsets.
	(PyPicmanTile_Type): convert to use getsets.

	* pypicman-image.c (PyPicmanImage_Type): convert getattr and setattr
	routines into getsets.

2002-08-29  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* pypicman-image.c (img_repr): check if picman_image_get_filename()
	returns NULL.

	* plug-ins/picmancons.py: fix up plugin, so that I can test the rest
	of pypicman.

	* *.py, plug-ins/*.py: many updates to Python code to work with
	new PyGTK.  I can start a plug in now.

2002-08-28  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* *.c, pypicman.h: split module into multiple files, and convert
	types to Python 2.2 style types.  Still need to fix some of the
	getattr routines.

	* picmanmodule.c: various updates to get it to compile with latest
	picman.  Still need to merge in changes to toplevel configure.in.

2000-09-23  Kevin Turner  <acapnotic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* picmanmodule.c (newpfobject): use correct type for enums

	* plug-ins/gtkcons.py (Console.run): set _ after evaluating a 
	statement, so _ may be used as it is in the python interpreter.

2000-09-20  Kevin Turner  <acapnotic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plug-ins/pdbbrowse.py (pars): Oops.  When we did
	s/PARAM_/PDB_/, we forgot to do s/6/4/ (the length
	of the prefix changed).

	* picmanmodule.c: Filter this through remove_cruft,
	finishing the libpicman renaming (and further ensuring
	that it won't work with older libpicmans).

2000-08-10  Kevin Turner  <acapnotic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* picmanenums.py: This file now autogenerated by
	tools/pdbgen/enumcode-py.pl

	* picmanfu.py: 
	* picmanmodule.c: renaming fixes for libpicman 1.2

	* plug-ins/pdbbrowse.py (pars): s/PARAM_/PDB_/

2000-08-09  Kevin Turner  <acapnotic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* picmanmodule.c (chn_getattr): under "layer", remove the call to
	picman_channel_get_layer_id() as this function does not exist.  It
	would be well for someone who knows pypicman better than I to review
	this change, but it keeps pypicman from being *completely* broken.

1999-11-11  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* doc/pypicman.sgml: updated documentation.

	* picmanmodule.c: applied patches from Hans Breuer to fix portability
	problems and also win32 compatibility.

	(lay_getattr): take is_rgb as a synonym for is_color/is_colour.
	(drw_parasite_attach):
	(drw_parasite_detach): change to new naming scheme.
	(img_parasite_attach): 
	(img_parasite_detach): same here.
	(picman_Parasite_find): 
	(picman_Parasite_attach): 
	(picman_Parasite_detach): same here.
	(chn_getattr): added is_rgb as a synonym for is_colour, and
	is_layer_mask as a synonym for layer_mask.

1999-07-08  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* plug-ins/shadow_bevel.py: added {disable,enable}_undo() calls.  Also
	made it possible to turn off the creation of a shadow.

	* plug-ins/foggify.py: added disable_undo() and enable_undo() calls
	round the plugin code.

	* plug-ins/Makefile.am: forgot to add foggify and shadow_bevel to
	the EXTRA_DIST list.

	* picmanui.py: fixed some small bugs that caused an exception when
	loading on some versions of python.  Weird thing is, it did not
	cause problems on my computer (using 1.5.1)

1999-07-05  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* plug-ins/foggify.py, plug-ins/shadow_bevel.py: two new example
	scripts.

1999-07-04  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* picmanmodule.c: added support for parasites.  This new code is
	conditionally compiled if PICMAN_HAVE_PARASITES is defined.
	Added other picman 1.1 features to picmanmodule.

1999-07-03  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* picmanmodule.c (initpicman): added {major,minor,micro}_version constants
	to picmanmodule.
	(*) removed all the empty __doc__ strings -- they were just wasting
	space, and I have other docs in there now.

	* plug-ins/clothify.py (python_clothify): same here.

	* plug-ins/sphere.py (python_sphere): some small hacks to get the
	plugin to work with both picman 1.0 and 1.1 -- using the pattern
	"if pdb.picman_whatever.nparams == n" to check if the img parameter
	should be removed.

	* plug-ins/pdbbrowse.py (BrowseWin.extension_pdb_browse): fixed
	small bug.

1999-07-02  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* plug-ins/whirlpinch.py (python_whirl_pinch): adjusted plug in to
	work with drawable changes.

	* picmanmodule.c: removed the drawable type -- now only layer or channel
	types are used.  Also moved the drawable type's methods to both the
	layer and channel object types.  Also added some of the attributes of
	the drawable object to layer and channel objects (some aren't needed
	anymore, since layers are clearly defined as layers, and channels
	as channels).
	Make tile and pixel region objects keep a reference to their
	associated drawable.
	Added attributes has_alpha, is_colour, is_grey and is_indexed to
	layer and channel objects.

1999-06-22  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* picmanplugin.py: renamed from plugin.py.  This is mainly to reduce
	namespace polution.
	
	* getvals.py: removed file.  It has been replaced by the much more
	functional picmanfu module.

	* plug-ins/picmancons.py: added a browse button that will display the
	pdbbrowse window, which can then be used to choose a pdb function.
	The selected pdb function gets its prototype inserted on the
	command line.

	* plug-ins/pdbbrowse.py: converted to use GTK+ widgets and picmanfu.

	* plug-ins/picmancons.py: converted to use picmanfu and gtkcons.py.
	
	* plug-ings/gtkcons.py: a GTK replacement for tkcons.py.
	
	* plug-ins/whirlpinch.py, plug-ins/sphere.py: converted these two
	to use picmanfu.
	
	* picmanshelf.py (shelf): some changes so that the picman internal types
	will pickle correctly.

	* picmanmodule.c (initpicman): export the type objects for picmanmodule's
	internal types.  This is mainly to help get pickling to work
	correctly.
	(_id2*): new functions to help convert id's to the builtin types.

	* plug-ins/clothify.py: converted to use picmanfu module.

1999-06-21  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* picmanfu.py: a simplified interface to writing PICMAN plugins.  It
	handles all the user interaction stuff and saving the last used
	values.  It uses pygtk, so should match the interface of the rest
	of picman.

	* picmanui.py: new file that implements a number of useful widgets
	for use with the interfaces of plugins.  It requires pygtk.

	* picmanmodule.c (tuple_to_GParam): accept None for layer, channel
	or drawable arguments to PDB functions.  This value gets treated
	like an ID of -1.
	(img_cmp, lay_cmp, chn_cmp, drw_cmp): added compare functions so
	that the == operator works as expected with those object types.
