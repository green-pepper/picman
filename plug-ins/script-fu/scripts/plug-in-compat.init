; The Scheme code in this file provides some compatibility with
; scripts that were originally written for use with older versions of
; PICMAN.
;
; It provides PDB procedures that used to be provided by plug-ins that
; were since then removed from the PICMAN distribution. You should not
; use these in newly written scripts as the functions defined here may
; be removed at some later date.
