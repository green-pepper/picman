 * (Or, "Why Maze is Faster Than Checkerboard.")
 *
 * Assuming calling memcpy is faster than using loops.
 * Row buffers are nice...
 *
 * Assume allocating memory for row buffers takes a significant amount
 * of time.  Assume drawbox will be called many times.
 * Only allocate memory once.
 *
 * Do not assume the row buffer will always be the same size.  Allow
 * for reallocating to make it bigger if needed.  However, I don't see
 * reason to bother ever shrinking it again.
 * (Under further investigation, assuming the row buffer never grows
 * may be a safe assumption in this case.)
 *
 * Also assume that the program calling drawbox is short-lived, so
 * memory leaks aren't of particular concern-- the memory allocated to
 * the row buffer is never set free.
 */

/* Further optimizations that could be made...
 *  Currently, the row buffer is re-filled with every call.  However,
 *  plug-ins such as maze and checkerboard only use two colors, and
 *  for the most part, have rows of the same size with every call.
 *  We could keep a row of each color on hand so we wouldn't have to
 *  re-fill it every time...  */
