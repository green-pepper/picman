Wilber.xcf.gz.README
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is Wilber, the Picman Mascot.

Picman is a image manipulation program for unix computers, see 
http://www.picman.org for more detais.

The use of Wilber.xcf.gz is free, though it would be kind of you to mention 
the original author (Tuomas Kuosmanen <tigert@picman.org>) somewhere.

Enjoy.
